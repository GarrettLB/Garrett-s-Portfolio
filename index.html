        <h2>About me</h2>
      
        <p>Here's a few facts about me: My name is Garrett. I am currently 22 years old and I live in a Metro-Atlanta city in Georgia named Marietta. 
          I graduated early from highschool at 16 and took a 2 year Welding and Joining Technologies course at Chattahoochee Tech at 17. 
          In my spare time I pursue weight lifting and sports. 
          And although not very physichal like my other interests, I've always been interested in computers!
        </p>

        <p>
          My last several jobs over the years have all been in the contruction feild. 
          I've held several different positions, with a wide range from general construction to grading to framing to welding to electrical.
          But it's time for a change! I started self-learning how to code and fell in love with it. 
          I liked it so much I even enrolled in GA Tech's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp! 
          I'm enjoying the journey of learning and am eager for my first job in the feild.
